Respository for Lab 2 GEOG 458

I compared twitter tweets with the word â€œhappy", both crawlers had the same coordinates.
The first data crawler was on wednesday morning.
The second time was thursday in the afternoon around 3PM. I wanted to make this comparison to see the moods of
people and how they shifted throughout the days. If morning or afternoon made a difference in
the number of tweets.

When I was looking at the CSV files many tweets for wednesday morning were about birthdays, but thursday afternoon
had more happy tweets because of friday or because of 4/20.
A prediction I can make is people will have more happy tweets friday mornings as people are excited about the weekend.


2. When generating these maps I wanted to make it symbolized with the twitter logo as markers. There are more tweets in the afternoon, this could be people getting off work, or having lunch. There are more tweets in the south at the AM time period. PM tweets vary locations along the west, south and northeast.

3. When analyzing the word clouds, both seemeed very similar I expected a variance between the times and days.
Both word clouds had the word happy and birthday as the main words.The morning crawler had words like "today", "mom", "much", "late", or "Tuesday" that immediatly pop out.
The PM word cloud doesn't have many english words as the
AM crawler. I minor issue that can be fixed is the random symbols, many tweets
had hyperlinks or emojis that couldn't be translated into the excel sheet.
Analyzing emojis throughout the AM and PM can give context of how people are feeling, and this can be a project for the future.
