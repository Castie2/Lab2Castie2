I compared twitter tweets with the word â€œhappy", both crawlers had the same coordinates.
The first data crawler was on wednesday morning.
The second time was thursday in the afternoon around 3PM. I wanted to make this comparison to see the moods of
people and how they shifted throughout the days. If morning or afternoon made a difference in
the number of tweets.

When I was looking at the CSV files many tweets for wednesday morning were about birthdays, but thursday afternoon
had happy friday because of time zones, or because of 4/20.
A prediction I can make is people will have more happy tweets friday mornings as people are excited about the weekend.


2. export the two maps to the repository and then insert them to the readme.md. Please compare them and briefly discuss why they represent different geospatial patterns on the map. (POINT 15)
When analyzing the word clouds, both seemeed very similar I expected a variance between the times and days.
